      <h3>Fullstack Development for Enterprise Project Management Webapp</h3>
      <p>Technologies Used: Rails, React</p>
      <p>Currently, I'm working on project accounting features and permissions.</p>
      <h3>Ethereum Blockchain Tool</h3>
      <p><strong>Technologies Used: Go, Postgres, Ethereum, Solidity</strong></p>
      <p>
        I helped build a caching layer for the Ethereum blockchain. The tool empowers developers to query their Ethereum dapp's current and historical data
        on the blockchain through conventional SQL queries. My work involved creating complex database migrations and queries.

      <h3>Frontend Development for Data Visualization App that Encourages Civic Engagement</h3>
      <p><strong>Technologies Used: Javascript with Flow for typing, React, Redux, Jest, styled-components, Express</strong></p>
      <p>
        I was a frontend developer for a webapp that aggregates data from a variety of government agencies and visualizes that data so that citizens can understand what the government does.
        I added the ability to view more granular (state and local) data. The app was a few years old when I started and already suffered from a lot of tech debt. My work included:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Refactoring existing React components to understand a different data structure, adding types with Flow, and adding unit tests throughout the codebase
          </li>
          <li>
            Refactoring Redux state management to handle fetching/storing/selecting new data and adding unit tests for new and existing actions, reducers, and selectors
          </li>
          <li>
            Creating/styling new React components to allow users to view different types of charts, transitioning from Radium to styled-components
          </li>
          <li>
            Working with our API partner to define new ways to model the data and creating a mock API in Express and CouchDB to
            use during development so we don't need to wait for the API partner to build new features
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Fullstack development for Background Screening App</h3>
      <p><strong>Technologies Used: Elixir/Phoenix/Ecto, React, Typescript</strong></p>
      <p>
        I integrated a third party background check API in the client's candidate screening app. Now, the app can query and parse the api to provide a simpler user experience
        for the investigators and candidates who use the app.
        I created new React components that display the results from the additional background screenings and allow investigators and candidates to view and comment on the results.
      </p>

      <h3>Backend for Nutritional Supplement Startup</h3>
      <p><strong>Technologies Used: Python, Django REST, Postgres, Typescript, React, Redux Saga, Docker</strong></p>
      <p>
          I pair programmed to design and develop the API for the company's ecommerce platform.
          We built a recommendation engine, which takes user responses to a conversational bot, applies a fully configurable set of rules, and returns a product recommendation.
          I implemented the checkout process, which involved integrating with stripe to securely process payment information and manage subscriptions.
          I also modeled orders and integrated with the manufacturer's API to submit orders for production and shipping.
          I added support for transactional emails for order confirmation, shipping status, and more. These emails are sent asynchronously via Celery tasks.
          On the frontend, I implemented a complex page in TypeScript that allows users to add, remove, and edit the quantities of ingredients in their recommended order.
      </p>

      <h3>iOS App for Medical Device Company</h3>
      <p><strong>Technologies Used: Objective C, Cocoapods</strong></p>
      <p>
          I worked on an app that uses bluetooth to connect to a medical device and display usage data. THe dvice records the time of use and the amount of prescription administered.
          I added support for HealthKit to the app and built the Today Widget, which summarizes daily usage information in a convenient view.
          Additionally, I added account management features including new views, logic to support logging into multiple accounts, and account switching with the iOS Keychain.
          I added support for all device sizes and orientations with Autolayout for many existing screens and built views to alert users when there is no wifi or bluetooth during the device pairing process.
      </p>

      <h3>Sales Terminal Webapp for Nonprofit</h3>
      <p><strong>Technologies Used: Ruby, Sinatra, Javascript</strong></p>
      <p>
         I developed a mobile-first web app that allows salespeople to take donations on their mobile phones.
         I used Stripe to handle transactions and the Google Identity Platform to allow salespeople to access the app.
         Administrators can generate reports with information about all transactions.
