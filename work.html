      <h1>Work  üë©üèª‚Äçüíª</h1>
      <h3>Backend for Nutritional Supplement Startup</h3>
      <p><strong>Technologies Used: Python, Django REST, Postgres, Typescript, React, Redux Saga, Docker</strong></p>
      <p>
          I pair programmed to design and develop the API for the company's ecommerce platform.
          We built a recommendation engine, which takes user responses to a conversational bot, applies a fully configurable set of rules, and returns a product recommendation.
          I implemented the checkout process, which involved integrating with stripe to securely process payment information and manage subscriptions.
          I also modeled orders and integrated with the manufacturer's API to submit orders for production and shipping.
          I added support for transactional emails for order confirmation, shipping status, and more. These emails are sent asynchronously via Celery tasks.
          On the frontend, I implemented a complex page in TypeScript that allows users to add, remove, and edit the quantities of ingredients in their recommended order.

      <h3>iOS App for Medical Device Company</h3>
      <p><strong>Technologies Used: Objective C, Cocoapods</strong></p>
      <p>
          I worked on an app that uses bluetooth to connect to a medical device and display usage data. THe dvice records the time of use and the amount of prescription administered.
          I added support for HealthKit to the app and built the Today Widget, which summarizes daily usage information in a convenient view.
          Additionally, I added account management features including new views, logic to support logging into multiple accounts, and account switching with the iOS Keychain.
          I added support for all device sizes and orientations with Autolayout for many existing screens and built views to alert users when there is no wifi or bluetooth during the device pairing process.
      </p>

      <h3>Sales Terminal Webapp for Nonprofit</h3>
      <p><strong>Technologies Used: Ruby, Sinatra, Javascript</strong></p>
      <p>
         I developed a mobile-first web app that allows salespeople to take donations on their mobile phones.
         I used Stripe to handle transactions and the Google Identity Platform to allow salespeople to access the app.
         Administrators can generate reports with information about all transactions.
