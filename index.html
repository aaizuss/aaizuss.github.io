        <p>
          Hi! I'm Amanda. I'm a software engineer living in Los Angeles ‚òÄÔ∏èüå¥. 
          In 2017, I graduated from <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Chicago</a> with a degree in Computer Science.
          My favorite computer science courses there were Programming Languages, Usable Security, and iOS Development.
          Now, I work at a software consultancy called <a href="https://8thlight.com" target="_blank">8th Light</a>.
          I write code with empathy for the people who will read and contribute to it, which means I strive to write durable, expressive, well-tested code.
        </p>
        <p>
          At UChicago, I lead the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/compileHer/" target="_blank">compileHer</a>
          curriculum team. CompileHer introduces middle school girls to programming and inspires them to explore how they can use technology. As someone who has always been
          passionate and curious about technology but did not initially feel qualified enough to pursue computer science, compileHer's mission is extremely important to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          At 8th Light, I've worked on projects
          in Swift (iOS), Ruby (Rails), Javascript/Typescript (React), Python (Django), and Elixir (Phoenix), and I'm excited to continue to learn
          new skills and help a variety of companies build better software.

          I like vegetables, type safety, walking fast, women's soccer, and living near large bodies of water.
          I used to make <a href="https://youtube.com/italkapple" target="_blank">YouTube videos</a>
          about software and technology in general (most of them are private now, but I've left a few up because it was a huge part of my life from middle school through high school).</p>

              Swift is my favorite language, so I was thrilled that I got to help build this physical therapy app with it! The app allows patients to complete exercises at home and track their recovery progress, and it motivates them with achievements and reminders.
              The app queries data from the .NET backend via a GraphQL API. I touched nearly every feature, but I was mostly responsible for implementing the Exercise Program in iOS.
              This allows patients to view their exercise schedule prescribed by their clinician, watch looping videos, learn how to do each exercise and why they are important, mark which exercises they complete, leave
              feedback about the exercises, and earn achievements for following their program. I also buit an interactive onboarding flow to help patients learn about the home exercise program.

              I was a frontend developer for a webapp that aggregates data from a variety of government agencies and visualizes that data so that citizens can understand what the government does.
              I added the ability to view more granular (state and local) data. The app was a few years old when I started and already suffered from a lot of tech debt. My work included:

                <li>
                  Refactoring existing React components to understand a different data structure, adding types with Flow, and adding unit tests throughout the codebase

                <li>
                  Refactoring Redux state management to handle fetching/storing/selecting new data and adding unit tests for new and existing actions, reducers, and selectors
                </li>
                <li>
                  Creating/styling new React components to allow users to view different types of charts, transitioning from Radium to styled-components
                </li>
                <li>
                  Working with our API partner to define new ways to model the data and creating a mock API in Express and CouchDB to

              and allow investigators and candidates to view and comment on the results.

              I pair programmed to design and develop the API for the company's ecommerce platform.
              We built a recommendation engine, which takes user responses to a conversational bot, applies a fully configurable set of rules, and returns a product recommendation.
              I implemented the checkout process, which involved integrating with stripe to securely process payment information and manage subscriptions.
              I also modeled orders and integrated with the manufacturer's API to submit orders for production and shipping.
              I added support for transactional emails for order confirmation, shipping status, and more. These emails are sent asynchronously via Celery tasks.
              On the frontend, I implemented a complex page in TypeScript that allows users to add, remove, and edit the quantities of ingredients in their recommended order.

              I added support for HealthKit to the app and built the Today Widget, which summarizes daily usage information in a convenient view.
              Additionally, I added account management features including new views, logic to support logging into multiple accounts, and account switching with the iOS Keychain.
              I added support for all device sizes and orientations with Autolayout for many existing screens and built views to alert users when there is no wifi or bluetooth during the device pairing process.
