      <h1>Hi! I'm <strong>Amanda</strong> ðŸŒŸ</h1>
      <p>I recently graduated from <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Chicago</a>,
      where I studied Computer Science. As a software developer, I strive
      to write expressive, durable code. Now, I work at a software consultancy called
      <a href="https://8thlight.com" target="_blank">8th Light</a>.</p>

      <p>At 8th Light, I've worked on projects
      in Python, Elixir, Javascript/Typescript, Swift, Objective-C, and Java, and I'm excited to continue to learn
      new skills and help a variety of companies build better software.
      Read more about <a href="work.html">what I've worked on</a>.</p>

      <p>At UChicago, I lead the
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/compileHer/" target="_blank">compileHer</a>
        curriculum team. Our goal is introduce middle school girls to programming
        and inspire them to explore how they can use technology. As someone who has always been
        passionate and curious about technology but did not initially feel qualified enough
        to pursue computer science, compileHer's mission is extremely important to me.</p>

      <p>I'm excited about iOS development in Swift. When I was first learning iOS development, I built a tool called
        <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blend-create-gradient-wallpapers/id1153425547?mt=8" target="_blank">
          Blend</a> for creating gradient backgrounds. When I have time, I'd like to rewrite it...</p>

      <p>I like vegetables, walking fast, and <a href="https://twitter.com/aaizuss/status/745467182830649345">
        living near large bodies of water</a>. Twitter is my favorite social network.
        I used to make <a href="https://youtube.com/italkapple" target="_blank">YouTube videos</a>
        about software and technology in general.</p>
